# DiveO

DiveO is the original experience sharing app specially designed for scuba divers. Allows divers to log and share dives they have gone on all around the world.

A diver signs up and creates a profile page detailing their name, home base, certification level, number of dives they've logged, and a list of dives. 

Main page is a user feed displaying the new dives a diver and other divers have completed.

The diver or other diver friends can view a diver's dive log.

Clicking on a particular dive displays the dive's details. Page includes dive site name, location on map via Google Map Api, date and time, depth, time under, experience description, and carousel of photos taken from dive.


# Upcoming Features

Diver will be able to log the geographical location of a dive site when creating a dive object. Using Google Maps Geolocation API, diver will store Latitude and Longitude of dive location, and have it display on the dive details page.
